# Resource-Utils

Some utilities i wrote for consistency and modifiability of Resourcepacks.

Here's a few things you can do now: 
- Disable the Player-Model in the Inventory
- Change the texture of the inventory slot-highlight (when hovered over a slot)
- Change Water Colors, YEEEEEEE! Seriously Mojang, Add this already!
- And more features in the future.
  - If you have ideas, just create an issue.
